## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/mainnetwallet/MultiAI-Router.git
cd MultiAI-Router
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
notepad .env
npm run ui:build     # build the control panel (optional — Router can build it automatically)
npm start
```

Default server:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8788` for the control panel.

### Windows `Router` command

Install the repository launcher once from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-router.ps1
```

Open a new PowerShell window. From then on, run:

```powershell
Router
```

The launcher changes to the repository directory, installs dependencies if needed,
builds the control panel if `ui/dist/index.html` is missing, opens the control panel
in the browser, and starts the gateway on `127.0.0.1:8788`. If the panel has not been
built, that address serves a short page explaining how to build it — the
gateway itself needs no build step and is unaffected.

## Configuration

A provider needs:

- API keys
- Models
- Base URL

Configure them in `.env`.

Retryable statuses:

```text
401,402,403,404,408,409,425,429,500,501,502,503,504,520,521,522,523,524,529
```

## Endpoints

### Gateway (public)

| Method | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| GET | /health |
| GET | /v1/models |
| POST | /v1/messages |
| POST | /v1/responses |
| POST | /v1/chat/completions |
| POST | /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent |

Optional pin headers (same auth as the other gateway endpoints) call one exact
target instead of letting the router choose — the Playground uses them:

| Header | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `x-multi-ai-pin-provider` | Only this provider's targets are eligible. With a request `model`, only that model on that provider. |
| `x-multi-ai-pin-key-index` | With a provider pin, only that 0-based key. Ignored without one. |

A pinned request never falls back to another provider, key or model, and it
ignores cooldown so a rate-limited key can still be tested. A pin that matches
no configured target returns `404 no_route`.

### Control panel (read-only)

Served under `/api`. Requires `MULTIAI_ROUTER_API_KEYS` when that is set; open
otherwise. None of these can change routing, health or provider behaviour.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /api/health | Health with provider rollups and monitor state |
| POST | /api/health/refresh | Run one health cycle now |
| GET | /api/providers | Provider rollup joined with safe config |
| GET | /api/models | Model catalogue with health and usage |
| GET | /api/requests | Request log (`limit`, `cursor`, `outcome`, `provider`, `protocol`, `status`) |
| GET | /api/requests/:id | One request's full lifecycle |
| GET | /api/router/preview | The routing decision for a protocol/model |
| GET | /api/analytics | Series and breakdowns (`range=5m\|15m\|1h\|6h\|24h\|7d`) |
| GET | /api/config | Effective configuration, secrets as counts only |
| GET | /api/system | Runtime, uptime and health-monitor scheduling |

`/api/config` reports key **counts** and env var **names**; it has no code path
that reads key material, so credentials cannot leak through it.

## Control Panel

A React + Vite single-page app in `ui/`, served by the gateway itself.

```powershell
npm run ui:dev      # dev server on :5173, proxying /api and /v1 to :8788
npm run ui:build    # production build into ui/dist
npm run test:ui     # frontend unit tests
npm run test:all    # backend + frontend
```

Twelve pages: Dashboard, Providers, Models, Health Monitor, Router, Fallback,
Playground, Requests, Live Logs, Analytics, Configuration, System.

To see the Live Logs page populated without real provider keys, run
`npm run ui:build` then `npm run demo:live-logs`. It starts the router against
scripted mock providers and prints a `/live-logs` URL; the traffic includes
`429` key 0 -> key 1 fallbacks and a request that exhausts its targets.

Real-time data uses polling with conditional `ETag` requests — the gateway has
no push channel and no fake one is invented. Polling pauses while the tab is
hidden and backs off when the gateway is failing.

## Health

Each `provider + model + key` target is ranked independently and probed in the
background every 15 minutes. A failed target is cooled down for 15 minutes
without affecting its sibling keys or models.

Probes are provider-aware and quota-free: they list the provider's models
rather than generating anything.

```text
Gemini             GET {base}/v1beta/models   (x-goog-api-key)
OpenAI-compatible  GET {base}/v1/models        (Bearer)
```

Probe outcomes that cannot establish health — a missing `/models` endpoint, or
a provider with no safe probe — leave the target `unknown`. The router reports
`unknown` rather than claiming a provider is healthy.

`GET /health` reports per-target `status` (`unknown`, `healthy`, `failed`,
`cooldown`), `score`, `lastStatus`, `lastReason`, latency, success/failure
counts and `cooldownUntil`. It never returns API keys or upstream bodies.

## Test

```powershell
npm test           # backend: 191 tests
npm run test:ui    # frontend: 47 tests
npm run test:all   # both
```

## Security

Keep real API keys in `.env`. Never commit credentials.

The control panel never receives provider credentials. `/api/config` reports a
key *count* per provider and the *names* of the environment variables to edit;
it renders as `Configured` / `Not configured` and never as a value.

The one secret the browser holds is the gateway's own client token
(`MULTIAI_ROUTER_API_KEYS`), entered in the panel's connection dialog. It is
stored in `sessionStorage` — never `localStorage`, never a URL, never a log —
and shown masked, with no reveal or copy control.

Every error message that crosses into the UI is scrubbed of credential-shaped
text on the server (`src/observability/sanitize.js`) and again in the browser
(`ui/src/lib/sanitize.js`), so a provider error cannot echo a key into a table,
a toast or the console.
